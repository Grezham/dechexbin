#**DecHexBin**
---

DecHexBin(Deciaml Hexadecimal Binary) is tiny TUI Quiz program. Randomly one day I realised I can't read hex or binary and immediately know it's decimal value, so I went online to find some "convert this number" games, and was assualted with ads.

So I made DecHexBin! No longer will we be held back by our lack of hexadecimal or binary conversion skills.

P.s. If you are wondering where the octodecimal is. I forgot that even existed until I started writing this README. My bad.
